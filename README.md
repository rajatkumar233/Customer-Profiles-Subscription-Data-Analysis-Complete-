I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the "Customer 100000" dataset to uncover key customer behavior patterns and subscription dynamics. This end-to-end project involved extensive data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploration using Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib. I performed in-depth visual analysis to understand customer demographics, subscription trends, and usage behavior, which helped highlight critical insights like peak churn periods and user lifetime value. To enhance the analysis, I applied machine learning models including clustering (K-Means) for customer segmentation and classification algorithms to predict customer churn with high accuracy. These insights played a pivotal role in shaping data-driven strategies for targeted marketing campaigns and personalized retention plans. The project not only demonstrated the power of data analytics in understanding customer journeys but also contributed to the formulation of actionable business decisions aimed at improving customer satisfaction and long-term loyalty.
