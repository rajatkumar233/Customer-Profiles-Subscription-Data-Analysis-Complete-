I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the "Customer 100000" dataset to uncover key customer behavior patterns and subscription dynamics. This end-to-end project involved extensive data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploration using Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib. I performed in-depth visual analysis to understand customer demographics, subscription trends, and usage behavior, which helped highlight critical insights like peak churn periods and user lifetime value. To enhance the analysis, I applied machine learning models including clustering (K-Means) for customer segmentation and classification algorithms to predict customer churn with high accuracy. These insights played a pivotal role in shaping data-driven strategies for targeted marketing campaigns and personalized retention plans. The project not only demonstrated the power of data analytics in understanding customer journeys but also contributed to the formulation of actionable business decisions aimed at improving customer satisfaction and long-term loyalty.

As part of a data science project, I led a comprehensive end-to-end analysis of the "Customer 100000" dataset with the goal of extracting meaningful patterns in customer behavior, identifying at-risk users, and informing strategic decision-making. The process began with rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values, outlier detection, and normalization to ensure model-ready data. I used Python libraries such as pandas for data wrangling, seaborn and matplotlib for visual analytics, and scikit-learn for applying advanced machine learning techniques. Exploratory data analysis revealed trends in customer demographics, subscription durations, engagement levels, and cancellation rates, helping to surface early indicators of churn.

To derive deeper insights, I implemented K-Means clustering to segment users based on behavioral metrics such as purchase frequency, usage patterns, and account age. This allowed for the development of targeted marketing personas. Additionally, I used classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to build predictive models that accurately forecasted customer churn. I evaluated model performance using cross-validation, confusion matrices, and ROC curves to ensure reliability.

The outcome of this project was a series of actionable insights and recommendations for enhancing customer retention and increasing revenue. I presented these findings through interactive dashboards and reports, enabling stakeholders to prioritize retention strategies such as personalized offers, improved onboarding, and proactive engagement for high-risk customers. The project not only strengthened my technical skills in data analytics and machine learning but also emphasized the importance of aligning data science with real-world business objectives.
